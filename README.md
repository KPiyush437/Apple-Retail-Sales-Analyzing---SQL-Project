# Apple-Retail-Sales-Analyzing---SQL-Project

Objective

Perform SQL-based analyses on Apple store sales and warranty datasets to extract actionable business insights. The goal is to demonstrate how fundamental and advanced SQL skills can be applied to evaluate store performance, product trends, warranty behavior, and long-term growth patterns across multiple countries. This project highlights practical decision-making skills that are crucial for business analysts.

Project Overview

This project uses over 1 million rows of Apple retail sales and warranty data collected from multiple stores worldwide. The dataset includes information on products, stores, sales transactions, and warranty claims. By solving a series of structured SQL problems, the project demonstrates how to analyze large-scale datasets, perform data segmentation, and answer real-world business questions using SQL fundamentals and advanced techniques.

The project is divided into three tiers of questions based on complexity:

Easy to Medium: Basic aggregations and counts, identifying top/bottom performers, sales summaries, and warranty statistics.

Medium to Hard: Time-based analysis, warranty timelines, country-level product performance, and identifying seasonal trends.

Complex: Correlation analysis, running totals using window functions, growth ratios, and advanced performance evaluation across multiple years.

Database Schema

The project uses five main tables:

stores: Store details including location, country, and store ID.

category: Product categories with unique identifiers.

products: Product details including launch date, price, and category.

sales: Transaction data linking stores and products with quantities sold.

warranty: Warranty claims with repair status and claim dates.

Skills Developed

SQL Fundamentals & Advanced Queries: Complex joins, aggregations, filtering, and window functions.

Data Analysis: Identifying trends, segmenting data by time and geography, correlation analysis.

Business Insights: Store performance evaluation, product trend analysis, warranty risk assessment.

Portfolio & Interview Ready: Demonstrates ability to translate SQL results into actionable business recommendations.
